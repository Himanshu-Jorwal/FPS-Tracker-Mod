Statement of Purpose
In most parts of the world, the law automatically grants exclusive Copyright and Related Rights to the creator or owner(s) of original works of authorship and databases (collectively, "Works").

Some owners, however, choose to forgo these rights entirely in order to contribute to a communal pool of creative, cultural, and scientific works (the "Commons"). This allows the public to freely build upon, modify, incorporate, reuse, and redistribute these Works for any purpose—including commercial ones—without fear of infringement claims. The goal? To encourage the growth of a free culture and support the creation of more creative works.

This act of relinquishment is entirely voluntary, with no expectation of compensation or additional recognition. When an owner (the "Affirmer") applies CC0 to their Work, they do so fully aware of their Copyright and Related Rights, and with the understanding of the legal impact of choosing to relinquish them.

1. Copyright and Related Rights
A Work released under CC0 may be protected by Copyright and Related Rights. These rights include, but are not limited to:

i. The right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display, communicate, and translate the Work.
ii. The moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s).
iii. Publicity and privacy rights connected to a person's image or likeness in the Work.
iv. Rights protecting against unfair competition related to the Work, with limitations outlined below.
v. Rights covering the extraction, dissemination, and reuse of data in the Work.
vi. Database rights, such as those arising under European regulations.
vii. Other similar rights that exist worldwide based on applicable laws or treaties.

2. Waiver
To the greatest extent allowed by law, the Affirmer voluntarily waives, abandons, and surrenders all of their Copyright and Related Rights, as well as any associated claims (both present and future), in the Work. This waiver is:

Global—it applies worldwide.
Permanent—it has no expiration date (unless the law says otherwise).
Unconditional—no strings attached.
The Affirmer makes this waiver for the benefit of the public and with the knowledge that their heirs and successors will not be able to revoke it. This means the public can enjoy the Work freely, without the threat of future legal claims.

3. Public License Fallback
In the unlikely event that the waiver is found to be invalid under the law, the Affirmer grants a royalty-free, non-transferable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to use the Work. This license allows anyone to:

Use the Work worldwide, for any duration allowed by law.
Make copies, distribute, or modify it for any purpose, including commercial ones.
This license kicks in the moment CC0 is applied to the Work, and will remain effective even if part of it is deemed legally invalid.

4. Limitations and Disclaimers
a. This document does not waive any trademark or patent rights that the Affirmer may hold.
b. The Work is offered "as-is". The Affirmer does not make any promises regarding the accuracy, quality, or fitness of the Work for a particular purpose. In short, use it at your own risk!
c. The Affirmer is not responsible for clearing any third-party rights that might apply to the Work. This includes ensuring that necessary permissions or consents are obtained.
d. Creative Commons is not involved in this process. They are not responsible for anything related to the Work or its use.
